Something to access Blizzard's WoW API

I've learned a *bit* of Python at this point and am looking for something "fun" to work out some better ways to manage data coming from REST APIs. While Blizzard's API doesn't work quite the same way as the ones I deal with at work (mostly ADO) I think I can make progress in my Py-education while doing something that doesn't feel like work.
